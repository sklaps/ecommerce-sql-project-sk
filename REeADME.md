  ## 🧭 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to understand how customers interact with an eCommerce platform — from 
viewing products to purchasing — and discover actionable business patterns.

Using real event logs, I explored:
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning:** Fixing null values, removing missing brands, validating event types.
- 🔍 **Exploratory Analysis:** Which brands and products perform best, how users behave by hour, and how many drop off before purchasing.
- 💰 **Revenue Insights:** Identifying top-earning brands and products.
- 👥 **Customer Segmentation:** Creating an RFM model (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to find VIPs and at-risk customers.

This work replicates what a junior data analyst would perform in a real-world business environment.

## ❓ Business Questions Answered

1. **Event Distribution:** How are different user actions (`view`, `cart`, `purchase`) distributed?  
2. **Conversion Funnel:** What percent of users move from viewing → adding to cart → purchasing?  
3. **Top Products:** Which products are purchased most often?  
4. **Top Brands by Average Price:** Which brands have the highest average selling price?  
5. **Top Brands by Revenue:** Which brands drive the most total revenue?  
6. **Hourly Activity:** During which hours do purchases peak?  
7. **Customer Segmentation (RFM):** Who are the VIP, loyal, and inactive customers?

Each question was solved using SQL and visualized in Excel for clearer business communication.

##   QUESTIONS

```sql
 🧮 Q1. How are user events distributed? (Views, Carts, Purchases)
SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) AS total_events
FROM new_project.small_file
GROUP BY event_type
ORDER BY total_events DESC;

chart

💡 Insights
Most actions are view events — typical for eCommerce browsing.
Only ~1.6% of views lead to purchases → potential for funnel improvement.
Marketing teams can target high-view, low-purchase categories to increase conversion.

 🧾 Q2. What percent of users move from viewing → cart → purchasing?
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM new_project.small_file WHERE event_type='view') AS total_views,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM new_project.small_file WHERE event_type='cart') AS total_carts,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM new_project.small_file WHERE event_type='purchase') AS total_purchases;

chart

💡 Insights
View-to-cart conversion: ~1.2%
Cart-to-purchase conversion: ~138% (repeat buyers or multiple items).
Funnel shows where users drop off — ideal area for UX or pricing optimization.

🛍️ Q3. Which are the top 10 most purchased products?

SELECT product_id, COUNT(*) AS purchase_count
FROM new_project.small_file
WHERE event_type = 'purchase'
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY purchase_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

chart

💡 Insights

Samsung and Apple dominate product-level sales.
Product IDs like 1004856 & 1004767 are top sellers.
These can be featured in ad campaigns or bundles.

💰 Q4. Which brands have the highest average selling price?

SELECT brand, ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS avg_price
FROM new_project.small_file
WHERE event_type = 'purchase' AND brand IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY brand
ORDER BY avg_price DESC
LIMIT 10;

chart

💡 Insights
Premium brands like Mercury and Apple show high average prices.
Indicates their luxury positioning in the market.
Helps pricing teams understand product tier gaps.

💵 Q5. Which brands drive the most total revenue?

SELECT brand, 
       ROUND(SUM(price), 2) AS total_revenue, 
       COUNT(*) AS total_purchases
FROM new_project.small_file
WHERE event_type = 'purchase' AND brand IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY brand
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;



💡 Insights
Apple generates the most total revenue (₹211,843), while Samsung leads in total purchases.
Apple’s fewer but high-value transactions show strong brand power.
Suggests upselling opportunities for mid-tier brands.

## 🧠 RFM Segmentation — Understanding Customer Value

### 🧩 What is RFM?
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) is a marketing analytics technique used to measure customer engagement and loyalty:
- **Recency** → How recently the customer made a purchase  
- **Frequency** → How often they purchase  
- **Monetary** → How much money they spend  

It helps identify **VIPs**, **loyal customers**, and **churn risks**.

### 🧮 SQL Query Used

```sql
WITH purchases AS (
    SELECT user_id,
           COUNT(*) AS frequency,
           SUM(price) AS monetary,
           TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, MAX(event_time), (SELECT MAX(event_time) FROM new_project.small_file)) AS recency_hours
    FROM new_project.small_file
    WHERE event_type = 'purchase'
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT *,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY recency_hours ASC) AS recency_score,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS frequency_score,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY monetary DESC) AS monetary_score,
       CONCAT(
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY recency_hours ASC),
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC),
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY monetary DESC)
       ) AS rfm_code,
       (
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY recency_hours ASC) +
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) +
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY monetary DESC)
       ) AS rfm_score
FROM purchases
LIMIT 100;
